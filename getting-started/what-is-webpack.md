**webpack** is a **module bundler**.

webpack takes modules with dependencies and generates static assets representing those modules.

## **Why another module bundler?**

Existing module bundlers are not well suited for big projects \(big single page applications\). The most pressing reason for developing another module bundler was [Code Splitting](http://webpack.github.io/docs/code-splitting.html) and that static assets should fit seamlessly together through modularization.

I tried to extend existing module bundlers, but it wasnâ€™t possible to achieve all goals.

## **Goals**

* Split the dependency tree into chunks loaded on demand
* Keep initial loading time low
* Every static asset should be able to be a module
* Ability to integrate 3rd-party libraries as modules
* Ability to customize nearly every part of the module bundler
* Suited for big projects

## **How is webpack different?**

#### **[Code Splitting](http://webpack.github.io/docs/code-splitting.html)**

webpack has two types of dependencies in its dependency tree: sync and async. Async dependencies act as split points and form a new chunk. After the chunk tree is optimized, a file is emitted for each chunk.

#### **[Loaders](http://webpack.github.io/docs/loaders.html)**

webpack can only process JavaScript natively, but loaders are used to transform other resources into JavaScript. By doing so, every resource forms a module.

#### **Clever parsing**

webpack has a clever parser that can process nearly every 3rd party library. It even allows expressions in dependencies like so `require("./templates/" + name + ".jade")`. It handles the most common module styles: [CommonJs](http://webpack.github.io/docs/commonjs.html) and [AMD](http://webpack.github.io/docs/amd.html).

#### **[Plugin system](http://webpack.github.io/docs/plugins.html)**

webpack features a rich plugin system. Most internal features are based on this plugin system. This allows you to customize webpack for your needs and distribute common plugins as open source.
